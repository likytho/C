I'm a telecommunicacionts engineering student at University of Vigo (Spain) and just wanna share my little application's code with everyone who thinks that could be so useful for any kind of uses.

Of course, we start it from zero because a lot of us haven't any idea about programming, and will be here were I'll put my codes, trying to help them and, at the same time, to improve myself learning how to use that plataform. 

That's my 2nd semester (really, that's only for 4 months) on the first degree year. 

Of course, every kind of sugerences or notes which you wanna share will be so greatful for me.

I wish you like it!

See U ;)
